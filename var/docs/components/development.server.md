### Development Server

> Without needing to install a webserver, and even having an SSL option, you can start developing right away!
```bash
$ cd [PATH]/[TO]/[ATOM]
$ ./bin/console.py server [PORT]
```
> And you will be running your webserver, with your atom code. It functions as a real representation, but this is not meant for production environments
